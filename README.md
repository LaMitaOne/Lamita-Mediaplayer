    LaMita Media Player (2022 Training Prototype) 
   
ℹ️ Status: Archived Concept / Historical Artifact    
    
📅 Context:     
This project was developed during last 4 days of a 4-week basic C# / WinForms training course in 2022.   
     
⚠️ What is this?    
It is a functional "clone" of my d7 media player created to test C# skills. It features:    
    
     Animated UI: Custom logic for sliding sidebars and animated controls.   
     Remote Control: A basic UDP listener to simulate an Android remote control app.   
     Playlist Logic: Implementation of trees, lists, and search filtering.    
      
   
⚠️ Important Notes (Read Before Running):    
   
     The "Tastedive" API: The code contains logic to search the tastedive.com API. This API is now defunct/changed.   
     The search function will NOT work. Do not try to use it.   
          
     Hard-Coded Paths: The application expects specific folders (like C:\temp) to exist. If you download this code, you need to create those folders yourself, or modify the C:\         \temp strings in the code, or it will crash.    
     This is NOT the final product. This was the "Week 4 Final Project" from the course.    
     Not really do something more on it, but i thought maybe someone can have some fun with it :P    
        
     so nope bugfixes u can do self :P
